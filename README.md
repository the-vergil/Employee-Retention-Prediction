# HR-Retention-Prediction (Machine Learning) (Classification)

### In this project we have to predict the retention of employees
### We have to do EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and Data exploration to find out the the dependencies of different features on employees retention
### And then we have to make a classification model for predicting the retention and then we'll save the model for future use using joblib

## Libraries used :
--> Numpy
--> Pandas
--> Matplotlib
--> Seaborn
--> Sklearn
--> Joblib
