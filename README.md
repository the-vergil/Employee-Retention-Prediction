# Employee-Retention-Prediction (Machine Learning) (Classification)

#### In this project we have to predict the retention of employees
#### We have to do EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and Data exploration to find out the the dependencies of different features on employees retention
#### And then we have to make a classification model for predicting the retention and then we'll save the model for future use using joblib

## Libraries used :
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Joblib
